Idl Data Provider, IDP

The purpose of this library is to provide the atomic data needed 
for stellar spectroscopy.

The following functions are supported:

partition_function:
  It has three options, partition functions from Gray, from Wittmann 
  and from Irwin. The value of PF is returned for the given ionization
  stage I, element Z and temperature T.

chi:
  It returns the ionization energy for the given ionization stage I and
  element Z.

abundance:
  It returns the logartighmic abundances (A(H) = 12) for the given 
  element Z

chemeqconst:
  Returns chemical equilibrium constant for a given diatomic molecule
  and given temperature.

levels: 
  Return the information on atomic level for a specified atom and
  configuration numbers

lines:
  Return the information on atomic transition for a specified atom and
  two levels

lande:
  Computes Lande factor

zeeman:
  Computes Zeeman splitting

saha:
  Computes nII*ne/nI for the given atom, lower ionization stage and
  temperature.

model:
  Loads model atmosphere with all columns. If it is not complete, then
  it uses an equilibrium balance to fill the missing columns. Possible
  models are: FALC (other FAL), VALC, HSRA, HOLMUL. It should return
  a structure with intuitivly names tags.

teff:
  Computes teff for a given model atmosphere and a set of the continuum
  opacities.

kappac:
  Returns the continuum opacity and the given wavelength for the given
  temperature and electron density (or pressure or density -> then the
  electron pressure is computed, used has to decide how).

The routines work for a single value arguments or for the arrays. For 
those that require some computations (pf, chemeqconst), there are
two possible outputs - sav file or array.
